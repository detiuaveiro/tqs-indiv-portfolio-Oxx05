A citizen can request the collecting of items for a specific date and approximate time slot. A basic description of the item(s) should be provided.

· For correct assignment of work lists, the citizen should pick its municipality from a closed list. It is important that locations are correctly provided.

· Upon successful booking, the user gets an access token to enable further inquiries (or even cancelation) of the service booking. With the token, the citizen can check details for an active reservation (and optionally cancel it).

· Each service request goes through different states (received, assigned, in progress,…); the evolution of states is (timestamped and) displayed in the details of an existing booking.

· The system should enforce rules to prevent bookings that go beyond reasonable service level limits or resource capabilities.

· The Staff can see all services requests and update their state.
